    "markdown": "### Attack \nA ship can perform one attack when it becomes the active ship during the Combat phase. To perform an attack, the ship resolves the following steps in order:\n\n1. **Declare Target:** The attacker may measure range to any number of enemy ships and check which enemy ships are inside his firing arc. Then the attacker chooses one of his weapons to attack with. Then he chooses one enemy ship to be the target and pays any costs required for the attack.\n\n    - If attacking with a primary weapon, the target must be inside the attacker’s firing arc and at Range 1–3.\n\n    - If attacking with a turret primary weapon, the target must be at Range 1–3 but does not need to be inside firing arc.\n\n    - If attacking with a secondary weapon, the target must be inside the attacker’s firing arc (unless otherwise specified) and at the weapon range indicated on the weapon’s Upgrade card.\n\n    - If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon, or if the attacker cannot pay any costs required for the attack, the attacker may choose a different weapon and target.\n\n    - After a valid weapon and target are chosen and any indicated costs are paid, the target is considered to be the defender.\n\n1. **Roll Attack Dice:** The attacker rolls a number of attack dice equal to its primary weapon value; if it is attacking with a secondary weapon, it rolls attack dice equal to the attack value on that weapon’s Upgrade card instead.\n\n    - The attacker resolves any card abilities that allow him to roll additional or fewer attack dice.\n\n    - If attacking at Range 1 with its primary weapon, the attacker rolls one additional attack die.\n\n    - All additions or subtractions to the number of attack dice being rolled occur before the player rolls the attack dice.\n\n1. **Modify Attack Dice:** The defender can resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify the attack dice. Then the attacker can modify his attack dice in one or more of the following ways as many times as possible:\n\n    - **Focus:** The attacker can spend a focus token to change all of his [Focus] results to [Hit] results.\n\n    - **Target Lock:** The attacker can spend a target lock he has on the defender to reroll any number of his attack dice.\n\n    - **Card Ability:** The attacker can resolve a card ability that modifies attack dice and that he has not already resolved during this attack.\n\n1. **Roll Defense Dice:** The defender rolls a number of defense dice equal to its agility value.\n\n    - The defender resolves any card abilities that allow him to roll additional or fewer defense dice.\n\n    - If defending at Range 3 against a primary weapon attack, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - If the attack is obstructed, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - All additions or subtractions to the number of defense dice being rolled occur before the player rolls the defense dice.\n\n1. **Modify Defense Dice:** The attacker can resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify the defense dice. Then the defender can modify his defense dice in one or more of the following ways as many times as possible:\n\n    - **Focus:** The defender can spend a focus token to change all of his [Focus] results to [Evade] results.\n\n    - **Evade:** The defender can spend an evade token to add one [Evade] result to his defense roll.\n\n    - **Card Ability:** The defender can resolve a card ability that modifies defense dice and that he has not already resolved during this attack.\n\n1. **Compare Results:** For each [Evade] result, the defender cancels one [Hit] or [Critical Hit] result. All [Hit] results must be canceled before any [Critical Hit] results may be canceled. If at least one [Hit] or [Critical Hit] result remains uncanceled, the defender is hit by the attack; otherwise, the attack misses.\n\n1. **Deal Damage:** If the defender was hit, it suffers one damage for each uncanceled [Hit] result and one critical damage for each uncanceled [Critical Hit] result. All damage must be suffered before any critical damage may be suffered.\n\n- A ship cannot attack a friendly ship.\n\n- A ship may choose not to perform its attack during the Combat phase, but during an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll no dice when it is supposed to roll dice.\n\n- If players would roll more dice than the maximum number that they have available, keep track of the rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of dice the player would have rolled all at once. Note that these dice are not considered rerolled for the purposes of modifying dice.",

See the diagram below.\n\n**Inside Firing Arc at Range X Example:** ![Inside Firing Arc at Range X Example](/static/images/rules/inside-firing-arc-range-x-example.png)\n\nA K-wing equipped with the Tactician Upgrade card is attacking with its turret primary weapon, and has a choice of three possible targets.

If it attacks the Firespray-31, it would roll 1 additional attack die, because the closest point to closest point measurement between the K-wing and the Firespray-31 is Range 1, and trigger Tactician, because the Firespray-31 is inside arc at Range 2. If the K-wing attacks the TIE Adv. Prototype (which is equipped with Autothrusters), the closest point to closest point measurement between the K-wing and the TIE Adv.

This includes faceup damage cards, any relevant tokens, rules concerning a particular bomb or other munition, discarded upgrade cards, and any other information continuously available to all players.\n\n    All players are entitled access to open information and cannot hide open information from an opponent or omit specific details. A player must allow his or her opponent to discover the information themselves if they attempt to do so.\n\n- Derived information is any information about the game, game state, or ships all players have had the opportunity to learn through card/game effects or through the process of deduction using open information. This includes a player’s current score, how many Direct Hit damage cards might remain in a damage deck, which ship a dial belongs to, etc.\n\n    Derived information may be marked with the use of a token or other indicator so that players remember the information. A player cannot misrepresent derived information or hide the open information necessary to discover derived information.\n\n    If derived information is dependent on a player’s previous decision or action, he or she must answer truthfully when asked about that decision or action. For example, Steph chooses to use Corran Horn’s ability during the End phase. During the following Planning phase, Bryan forgets whether Corran Horn used his ability or not and asks Steph. Steph must answer honestly that Corran Horn did use his ability the previous turn.\n\n- Hidden information is any information about the game, game state, or ships unavailable to one or more players. This includes facedown damage cards, facedown maneuver dials, cards within the damage deck, etc.\n\n    A player cannot learn hidden information without the aid of a game effect, rule, or another player verbally communicating the information. However, if a player that has access to hidden information about the game or a card and chooses to verbally share it with his or her opponent, that player is not required to tell the truth.",

For example, if a ship performs a free barrel roll action granted by Expert Handling, it could use that action as a trigger for Push the Limit. After Push the Limit resolves, Expert Handling finishes resolving.\n\nAdditionally, the free action granted from Push the Limit can itself trigger other abilities that occur after performing an action.

This is especially true for a large ship attempting to perform a turn maneuver that overlaps another ship. To accurately resolve these collisions, set the turn template in place to mark the position of the large ship, remove the ship from the play area temporarily, and place a [[Straight]] template on each end of the turn template. Then, resolve the collision as normal, moving the ship backward along the template until it no longer overlaps another ship. Use the [[Straight]] templates as a visual reference while moving the ship, adjusting the ship so that the front and rear guides remain centered over the templates.\n\n**Large Ship Collision Example:** ![Large ship collision example](/static/images/rules/large-ship-collision-example.png)\n\nBoba Fett attempts to execute a [[Turn Left] 1] turn maneuver that causes it to overlap Rookie Pilot.

Each ship in the squad must have the correct plastic ship, ship token, maneuver dial, Ship card, and any Upgrade cards chosen, as well as ID tokens if necessary.\n\n1. **Determine Initiative:** The player with the lowest squad point total chooses which player has initiative. If players are tied, the players randomly determine which player chooses who has initiative.\n\n1. **Establish Play Area:** Establish a 3' x 3' (0.9144 m) play area (or alternative size) on a flat surface such as a table or playmat.\n\n1. **Place Obstacles:** Starting with the player with initiative, each player chooses one obstacle token from the obstacles available and places it in the play area. The players place a total of six obstacle tokens. Obstacles cannot be placed at Range 1 of each other, or at Range 1–2 of an edge of the play area. After the sixth obstacle is placed, the player who does not have initiative chooses an edge of the play area to be his own; his opponent’s edge is the opposite side of the play area.\n\n1. **Place Forces:** The players place their ships into the play area in order from lowest pilot skill to highest pilot skill. If multiple ships tie in pilot skill, the player with initiative places his ships with that pilot skill first. Ships must be placed within Range 1 of their player’s edge.\n\n1. **Activate Shields:** Place a number of shield tokens on each Ship card equal to that card’s shield value.\n\n1. **Prepare Other Components:** Shuffle the Damage deck and place it facedown outside the play area within reach of both players along with the maneuver templates, dice, range ruler, and the remaining tokens.",
