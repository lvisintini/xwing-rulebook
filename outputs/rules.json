For example, if Tel Trevura has the “Damaged Cockpit” Damage card and is destroyed (for the first time) by a ship at pilot skill 5, he discards his damage cards.

To perform an attack, the ship resolves the following steps in order:\n\n1. **Declare Target:** The attacker may measure range to any number of enemy ships and check which enemy ships are inside his firing arc. Then the attacker chooses one of his weapons to attack with. Then he chooses one enemy ship to be the target and pays any costs required for the attack.\n\n    - If attacking with a primary weapon, the target must be inside the attacker’s firing arc and at Range 1–3.\n\n    - If attacking with a turret primary weapon, the target must be at Range 1–3 but does not need to be inside firing arc.\n\n    - If attacking with a secondary weapon, the target must be inside the attacker’s firing arc (unless otherwise specified) and at the weapon range indicated on the weapon’s Upgrade card.\n\n    - If there is no valid target for the chosen weapon, or if the attacker cannot pay any costs required for the attack, the attacker may choose a different weapon and target.\n\n    - After a valid weapon and target are chosen and any indicated costs are paid, the target is considered to be the defender.\n\n1. **Roll Attack Dice:** The attacker rolls a number of attack dice equal to its primary weapon value; if it is attacking with a secondary weapon, it rolls attack dice equal to the attack value on that weapon’s Upgrade card instead.\n\n    - The attacker resolves any card abilities that allow him to roll additional or fewer attack dice.\n\n    - If attacking at Range 1 with its primary weapon, the attacker rolls one additional attack die.\n\n    - All additions or subtractions to the number of attack dice being rolled occur before the player rolls the attack dice.\n\n1. **Modify Attack Dice:** The defender can resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify the attack dice. Then the attacker can modify his attack dice in one or more of the following ways as many times as possible:\n\n    - **Focus:** The attacker can spend a focus token to change all of his [Focus] results to [Hit] results.\n\n    - **Target Lock:** The attacker can spend a target lock he has on the defender to reroll any number of his attack dice.\n\n    - **Card Ability:** The attacker can resolve a card ability that modifies attack dice and that he has not already resolved during this attack.\n\n1. **Roll Defense Dice:** The defender rolls a number of defense dice equal to its agility value.\n\n    - The defender resolves any card abilities that allow him to roll additional or fewer defense dice.\n\n    - If defending at Range 3 against a primary weapon attack, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - If the attack is obstructed, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - All additions or subtractions to the number of defense dice being rolled occur before the player rolls the defense dice.\n\n1. **Modify Defense Dice:** The attacker can resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify the defense dice. Then the defender can modify his defense dice in one or more of the following ways as many times as possible:\n\n    - **Focus:** The defender can spend a focus token to change all of his [Focus] results to [Evade] results.\n\n    - **Evade:** The defender can spend an evade token to add one [Evade] result to his defense roll.\n\n    - **Card Ability:** The defender can resolve a card ability that modifies defense dice and that he has not already resolved during this attack.\n\n1. **Compare Results:** For each [Evade] result, the defender cancels one [Hit] or [Critical Hit] result. All [Hit] results must be canceled before any [Critical Hit] results may be canceled. If at least one [Hit] or [Critical Hit] result remains uncanceled, the defender is hit by the attack; otherwise, the attack misses.\n\n1. **Deal Damage:** If the defender was hit, it suffers one damage for each uncanceled [Hit] result and one critical damage for each uncanceled [Critical Hit] result. All damage must be suffered before any critical damage may be suffered.\n\n- A ship cannot attack a friendly ship.\n\n- A ship may choose not to perform its attack during the Combat phase, but during an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll no dice when it is supposed to roll dice.\n\n- If players would roll more dice than the maximum number that they have available, keep track of the rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of dice the player would have rolled all at once. Note that these dice are not considered rerolled for the purposes of modifying dice.",

It may perform actions as normal.\n\n- **Combat Phase:** The ship may attack as normal.\n\n- Since an ionized ship is not assigned a maneuver dial, it is not treated as revealing a maneuver during the Activation phase.",

This is especially true for a large ship attempting to perform a turn maneuver that overlaps another ship. To accurately resolve these collisions, set the turn template in place to mark the position of the large ship, remove the ship from the play area temporarily, and place a [[Straight]] template on each end of the turn template. Then, resolve the collision as normal, moving the ship backward along the template until it no longer overlaps another ship. Use the [[Straight]] templates as a visual reference while moving the ship, adjusting the ship so that the front and rear guides remain centered over the templates.\n\n**Large Ship Collision Example:** \n\n![alt_text](/static/images/rules/large-ship-collision-example.png)\n\n\n\nBoba Fett attempts to execute a [[Turn Left] 1] turn maneuver that causes it to overlap Rookie Pilot.

After the players play the number of rounds they agreed upon, the game ends. Similarly, the players can use a time limit instead by agreeing on an amount of time to play. When the predetermined length of time has elapsed, the players finish the current round and the game ends.\n\nTo determine the winner of a round-limit or time-limit game, each player determines his score by summing the total squad point value of each **enemy** ship that was destroyed, including the cost of all Upgrade cards attached to those ships (even if they are discarded). The player with the highest score wins the game! If their scores are tied, the game ends in a draw.",

Each ship in the squad must have the correct plastic ship, ship token, maneuver dial, Ship card, and any Upgrade cards chosen, as well as ID tokens if necessary.\n\n1. **Determine Initiative:** The player with the lowest squad point total chooses which player has initiative. If players are tied, the players randomly determine which player chooses who has initiative.\n\n1. **Establish Play Area:** Establish a 3' x 3' (0.9144 m) play area (or alternative size) on a flat surface such as a table or playmat.\n\n1. **Place Obstacles:** Starting with the player with initiative, each player chooses one obstacle token from the obstacles available and places it in the play area. The players place a total of six obstacle tokens. Obstacles cannot be placed at Range 1 of each other, or at Range 1–2 of an edge of the play area. After the sixth obstacle is placed, the player who does not have initiative chooses an edge of the play area to be his own; his opponent’s edge is the opposite side of the play area.\n\n1. **Place Forces:** The players place their ships into the play area in order from lowest pilot skill to highest pilot skill. If multiple ships tie in pilot skill, the player with initiative places his ships with that pilot skill first. Ships must be placed within Range 1 of their player’s edge.\n\n1. **Activate Shields:** Place a number of shield tokens on each Ship card equal to that card’s shield value.\n\n1. **Prepare Other Components:** Shuffle the Damage deck and place it facedown outside the play area within reach of both players along with the maneuver templates, dice, range ruler, and the remaining tokens.",
