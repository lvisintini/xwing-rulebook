Then the attacker can modify his attack dice in one or more of the following ways as many times as possible:\n\n    - **Focus:** The attacker can spend a focus token to change all of his [Focus] results to [Hit] results.\n\n    - **Target Lock:** The attacker can spend a target lock he has on the defender to reroll any number of his attack dice.\n\n    - **Card Ability:** The attacker can resolve a card ability that modifies attack dice and that he has not already resolved during this attack.\n\n1. **Roll Defense Dice:** The defender rolls a number of defense dice equal to its agility value.\n\n    - The defender resolves any card abilities that allow him to roll additional or fewer defense dice.\n\n    - If defending at Range 3 against a primary weapon attack, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - If the attack is obstructed, the defender rolls one additional defense die.\n\n    - All additions or subtractions to the number of defense dice being rolled occur before the player rolls the defense dice.\n\n1. **Modify Defense Dice:** The attacker can resolve any card abilities that allow him to modify the defense dice.

All [Hit] results must be canceled before any [Critical Hit] results may be canceled. If at least one [Hit] or [Critical Hit] result remains uncanceled, the defender is hit by the attack; otherwise, the attack misses.\n\n1. **Deal Damage:** If the defender was hit, it suffers one damage for each uncanceled [Hit] result and one critical damage for each uncanceled [Critical Hit] result. All damage must be suffered before any critical damage may be suffered.\n\n- A ship cannot attack a friendly ship.\n\n- A ship may choose not to perform its attack during the Combat phase, but during an attack, a ship cannot choose to roll no dice when it is supposed to roll dice.\n\n- If players would roll more dice than the maximum number that they have available, keep track of the rolled results and reroll the dice necessary to equal the total number of dice the player would have rolled all at once. Note that these dice are not considered rerolled for the purposes of modifying dice.",

The upgrade bar along the bottom of a Ship card displays icons that represent which upgrades that ship can equip. For each icon shown in the upgrade bar, the ship can equip one Upgrade card with the matching icon.\n\nSome Upgrade cards have one or more of the following traits in their card text:\n\n- **Modification:** These upgrades can be equipped to any ship, but a ship is limited to one modification.\n\n- **Title:** These upgrades can be equipped to any ship, but a ship is limited to one title.\n\n- **Limited:** A ship cannot equip more than one copy of the **same** card with this trait.\n\n- **Rebel/Imperial/Scum only:** This upgrade can only be equipped to a ship of the specified faction.\n\n- **Small/Large/Huge ship only:** This upgrade can only be equipped to a ship of the specified size.\n\n- **Ship-type only:** This upgrade can only be equipped to a ship of the specified type. If the ship’s type includes the entirety of the restricted type, it can equip that upgrade. For example, a TIE/fo fighter can equip an Upgrade card restricted to “TIE Fighter only.”\n\n- When an Upgrade card is discarded, it is flipped facedown. The card is out of play for all purposes except when determining the total squad point cost of the ship to which it was equipped. If an Upgrade card is flipped faceup by a game effect, it returns to play equipped to the same ship.",

Each player plans maneuvers for his own ships and makes all decisions for his actions and attacks. Abilities that affect ships belonging to the same team (for example, the ability of “Epsilon Leader”) affect all ships on that team, regardless of who the owner is.\n\nPlayers win (and lose) together as a team. It is possible for all of one player’s ships to be destroyed, but for his team to win if his teammate manages to destroy all of the opposing team’s ships.\n\nPlayers on the same team may strategize against their opponents. Players are free to discuss any information with teammates (and opponents), but all discussion must take place in public (i.e., their opponents must be able to hear all discussion). Teammates may show each other the maneuvers chosen on their dials.",
