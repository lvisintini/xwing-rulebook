As questions arise during gameplay, players should reference this guide instead of the Learn to Play booklet.\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis guide is the definitive source for all **X-Wing** rules. Unlike the Learn to Play booklet, this guide addresses complex and unusual gameplay situations.\r\n\r\nThe main component of this guide is a glossary of important game terms, organized alphabetically. It also includes optional rules, an index, and a Quick Reference at the back of the booklet.\r\n\r\nThe rules in this guide can be read by any player at any point."
